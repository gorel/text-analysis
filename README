This is a program to analyze word, character, and symbol counts for a given file.  It is written in Ruby.

The program first prompts the user to give the location of a file.  It will then attempt to load that file.

If the file is loaded, the program will then split the string on all whitespace(space, tab, or newline), and delete any empty strings (which result from splitting over consecutive whitespace characters).

It gets the 'sanitized word' (no symbols) by calling word.gsub(/[^0-9a-z]+/i, ''), which is a regular expression to replace anything that isn't alphanumeric with '' (an empty string).  This effectively removes all symbols.

It gets the symbols in a similar way: by calling word.gsub(/[0-9a-z]+/i, ''), which is a regular expression to replace anything that IS alphanumeric with '' (an empty string).  This removes anything that isn't a symbol.

The program has three hashes: a words hash, a characters hash, and a symbols hash.  Each is updated according to the sanitized word and symbols we have just retrieved from the current word.

When the program is done parsing all words, it outputs the contents of the three hashes listed previously.

It ends by displaying the total amount of time that elapsed to parse the given file.
